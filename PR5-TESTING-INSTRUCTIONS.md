- [x] Verify a user-friendly error message is displayed
- [x] Verify the error message auto-dismisses after 5 seconds
- [x] Verify can still import valid videos after error

#### 7. Clip Switching Test
- [x] Import multiple video files

- [x] Click on different positions in timeline
- [x] Verify preview updates to correct clip and time
- [x] Verify playback works correctly at clip boundaries

## Test Results

✅ **ALL TESTS PASSED**

All 7 test categories completed successfully. The video player component is working as expected with:
- Universal timeline playback controls
- Smooth multi-clip playback
- Professional UX (preview follows playhead, independent of selection)
- User-friendly error handling
- Proper layout with responsive scaling

## Issues Found & Resolved

1. **Import Error - Fixed** ✅
   - Issue: `convertFileSrc` was imported from `@tauri-apps/api/tauri` (Tauri v1 path)
   - Solution: Changed import to `@tauri-apps/api/core` (Tauri v2 path)

2. **Layout Issues - Fixed** ✅
   - Issue: Play button was hidden behind timeline
   - Solution: Redesigned layout using CSS Grid with proper area allocation

3. **Video Type Error - Fixed** ✅
   - Issue: `.mov` files failing with "Video format not supported"
   - Solution: Added proper MIME type mapping (`video/quicktime` for .mov files)

4. **Technical Error Messages - Fixed** ✅
   - Issue: Raw FFprobe errors shown to users (e.g., "moov atom not found")
   - Solution: Parse FFprobe errors and provide user-friendly messages

5. **Architecture Refactoring - Completed** ✅
   - Issue: Play controls were clip-specific, not timeline-wide
   - Solution: Refactored to universal timeline playback with continuous multi-clip support

## Next Steps

✅ PR #5 is complete and ready for PR #6: Trim Functionality
