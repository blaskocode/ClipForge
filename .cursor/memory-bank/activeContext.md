### Immediate Next Steps (PR #5)
1. Create VideoPlayer component with HTML5 video element
2. Implement play/pause controls with state management
3. Add keyboard shortcuts (Spacebar, Delete)
4. Implement playhead synchronization with video playback
5. Add error handling for video loading failures

### Active Decisions

#### Memory Bank Approach
**Decision**: Create memory bank before starting development to track project patterns and maintain context across sessions.

**Rationale**: Following Cursor's memory bank pattern ensures I can maintain project knowledge and patterns consistently.

#### Development Sequence
**Decision**: Follow the 16-PR sequence from `clipforge-tasklist.md` sequentially.

**Rationale**: Each PR builds on the previous one. Skipping ahead causes dependency issues.

## Current Priorities (PR #1)

### High Priority
1. Download and configure FFmpeg binaries
2. Remove template code and create basic layout
3. Configure Tauri for file drop support
4. Test that dev environment works end-to-end

### Medium Priority
5. Add basic styling
6. Create component folder structure
7. Set up initial app state structure

### Low Priority
8. Add helpful comments
9. Create initial README content
10. Set up git (after working code exists)

## Recent Changes (Last Session)
- Created Timeline component with clip visualization and time ruler
- Implemented clip selection and deletion with confirmation dialog
- Added playhead indicator and timeline scrubbing functionality
- Fixed FFprobe path resolution and metadata extraction issues
- Replaced native alerts with custom UI notifications for better permissions
- Created PR4-TESTING-INSTRUCTIONS.md with detailed test procedures
- Created PR4-VERIFICATION.md documenting the implementation and test results
- Updated PR4-COMPLETE.md to reflect the completed state
- All manual tests passed successfully (10/10)
- Updated memory bank to reflect PR #4 completed state
- Ready to proceed with PR #5: Video Player Component

## Current Blockers
None. All PRs #1, #2, #3, and #4 complete and tested. Ready to proceed to PR #5.

## Context for Next Session
If returning to this project:
1. Check memory bank for current state
2. Resume from activeContext.md â†’ Current Work Focus
3. Continue with PR #5 tasks (Video Player Component)
4. Update activeContext.md after each completed PR

## Team/Coordination Notes
- Solo project
- No external dependencies on other team members
- Follow PRD deadlines strictly (MVP: Oct 28, Final: Oct 29)
