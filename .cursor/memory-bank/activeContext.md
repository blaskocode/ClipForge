4. âœ… Implemented extension validation for mp4, mov, webm (case-insensitive)
5. âœ… Added user-friendly error messages for all failure cases
6. âœ… Added unit tests (3 tests: nonexistent file, invalid extension, valid mp4)

3. âœ… Implemented drag & drop event listeners with visual feedback
4. âœ… Added clip limit validation (warning at 20 clips, hard limit at 50 clips)
5. âœ… Added bulk import protection to prevent exceeding clip limits
6. âœ… Created ImportButton React component
7. âœ… Enhanced clip state management with proper metadata
8. âœ… Implemented comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
9. âœ… Created test documentation with code verification for all test cases
10. âœ… Tested import functionality with various file types

### Immediate Next Steps (PR #4)
1. Create Timeline component with time ruler
2. Implement clip visualization with proportional widths
3. Add playhead indicator and synchronization
4. Implement clip selection and deletion
5. Add timeline scrubbing functionality

### Active Decisions

#### Memory Bank Approach
**Decision**: Create memory bank before starting development to track project patterns and maintain context across sessions.

**Rationale**: Following Cursor's memory bank pattern ensures I can maintain project knowledge and patterns consistently.

#### Development Sequence
**Decision**: Follow the 16-PR sequence from `clipforge-tasklist.md` sequentially.

**Rationale**: Each PR builds on the previous one. Skipping ahead causes dependency issues.

## Current Priorities (PR #1)

### High Priority
1. Download and configure FFmpeg binaries
2. Remove template code and create basic layout
3. Configure Tauri for file drop support
4. Test that dev environment works end-to-end

### Medium Priority
5. Add basic styling
6. Create component folder structure
7. Set up initial app state structure

### Low Priority
8. Add helpful comments
9. Create initial README content
10. Set up git (after working code exists)

## Recent Changes (Last Session)
- Added 50-clip hard limit to complement the existing 20-clip warning
- Added bulk import protection to prevent exceeding clip limits
- Created PR3-TEST-RESULTS.md with code verification for all test cases
- Created PR3-VERIFICATION-REPORT.md documenting the implementation
- Created PR3-ISSUES-RESOLVED.md summarizing fixes
- Verified all code changes with no linter errors
- Updated memory bank to reflect PR #3 completed state
- Ready to proceed with PR #4: Timeline Component

## Current Blockers
None. All PRs #1, #2, and #3 complete and tested. Ready to proceed to PR #4.

## Context for Next Session
If returning to this project:
1. Check memory bank for current state
2. Resume from activeContext.md â†’ Current Work Focus
3. Continue with PR #1 tasks starting from wherever we left off
4. Update activeContext.md after each completed PR

## Team/Coordination Notes
- Solo project
- No external dependencies on other team members
- Follow PRD deadlines strictly (MVP: Oct 28, Final: Oct 29)
