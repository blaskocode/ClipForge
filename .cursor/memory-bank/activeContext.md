### Recent Bug Fixes & Improvements

**Critical Bug Fixes:**
- âœ… **In/Out Point Timing Issue**: Fixed timing issues during playback using useRef for synchronous access
  - **Problem**: "If I'm trying to set In/Out Points while the video is playing, the lines do not show up where the playhead it at the moment I hit I or O"
  - **Root Cause**: React state staleness during playback - `playheadPosition` state updates are asynchronous
  - **Solution**: Added `playheadPositionRef` for synchronous access, removed stale state dependencies
  - **Technical Details**: useRef provides real-time access without waiting for React re-renders

- âœ… **Zoom Toast Removal**: "Never show the 'Timeline Zoom Updated' message"
  - **Problem**: Annoying and unnecessary feedback during zoom operations
  - **Solution**: Removed toast notification from zoom change handler
  - **Professional UX**: Zoom feedback is visual, not textual

- âœ… **Thumbnail Extraction Errors**: "I just got another thumbnail extraction failed error"
  - **Problem**: FFmpeg errors not logged clearly, no graceful degradation
  - **Solution**: Improved error logging, graceful fallback, partial results
  - **Technical Implementation**: Better FFmpeg error parsing, continue on individual failures

- âœ… **Duplicate Export Buttons**: "There are two Export Video buttons and there should only be one"
  - **Problem**: UI inconsistency with multiple export triggers
  - **Solution**: Consolidated export functionality into single button

- âœ… **New Project Confirmation**: "When I select New Project, a new project is created immediately without waiting for the user to confirm"
  - **Problem**: Destructive action without confirmation
  - **Solution**: Added confirmation dialog for new project creation

- âœ… **Layout Issues After Refactoring**: "The layout is broken (why is the timeline to the right of the Timeline Zoom window? Why are the In and Out Point buttons on the right side?)"
  - **Problem**: CSS refactoring broke the layout with components in wrong grid areas
  - **Solution**: Moved ZoomControls to controls-area, updated CSS Grid columns, refactored component styles for vertical sidebar layout
  - **Technical Details**: Changed grid-template-columns from 1fr 300px to 1fr 350px, updated all control components for vertical layout

- âœ… **Zoom Slider Cleanup**: "I'd like to remove the - and + buttons, and only use the slider, which should be centered"
  - **Problem**: Zoom slider had unnecessary buttons and wasn't properly centered
  - **Solution**: Removed zoom in/out buttons, centered the slider, updated CSS for better aesthetics
  - **Technical Details**: Removed onZoomIn/onZoomOut props, updated CSS with justify-content: center, removed button styles

- âœ… **Thumbnail Extraction Command Missing**: "Thumbnail extraction failed"
  - **Problem**: The extract_thumbnails command was accidentally removed during refactoring
  - **Solution**: Re-implemented robust extract_thumbnails command with enhanced error handling
  - **Technical Implementation**: Added comprehensive FFmpeg error logging, graceful degradation, partial results, temp file cleanup

**User Experience Improvements:**
- âœ… **Professional Keyboard Shortcuts**: Complete shortcut system implementation
  - **User Request**: "Add all recommended professional shortcuts"
  - **Implementation**: Cmd+N, Cmd+S, Cmd+O, Cmd+E, Cmd+Z, Cmd+Shift+Z, Spacebar, I/O, Arrow keys, J/K/L, Home/End, ?
  - **Professional Standards**: Matches industry-standard video editing applications

- âœ… **Toast Notification System**: User-friendly error handling
  - **User Request**: "Add all recommended error handling"
  - **Implementation**: Expandable error details, copy-to-clipboard, retry buttons
  - **Professional UX**: Non-intrusive but informative feedback

- âœ… **File Length Compliance**: "Are you enforcing the 500-line rule?"
  - **User Request**: Enforce all cursor rules, not just the 500-line rule
  - **Implementation**: Refactored all files to comply with limits
  - **Architecture**: Modular design with extracted utilities and components

**Technical Clarifications & Decisions:**
- âœ… **Undo/Redo Professional Behavior**: Playhead position excluded from history
  - **User Question**: "How do professional apps handle Undo and Redo?"
  - **Professional Decision**: Playhead movement is not undoable (matches Premiere Pro/Final Cut Pro)
  - **Implementation**: Custom useHistory hook with playhead separation

- âœ… **Project File Format**: JSON chosen over binary formats
  - **User Question**: "Make project files as JSON, or whatever is recommended"
  - **Technical Decision**: JSON for simplicity, cross-platform compatibility, and human readability
  - **Implementation**: Complete project state serialization with metadata

- âœ… **Mac-Only Focus**: Skipped Windows build per user request
  - **User Clarification**: "Skip Windows build for now"
  - **Implementation**: Mac .dmg packaging without code signing
  - **Technical Details**: Platform-specific FFmpeg binary bundling

### Active Decisions

#### Code Quality Standards
**Decision**: Enforce 500-line maximum limit for all source files to maintain code quality and readability.

**Implementation**: 
- Refactored App.tsx by extracting utilities (keyboardHandler, dragDrop, videoProcessing, projectManagement, zoomControls, audioControls)
- Split App.css into modular stylesheets (header-modals.css, controls.css, video-player.css, timeline.css)
- Maintained lib.rs under 500 lines by consolidating functions properly

#### Professional UX Standards
**Decision**: Implement industry-standard keyboard shortcuts and user experience patterns.

**Implementation**:
- Complete keyboard shortcut system (Cmd+N, Cmd+S, Cmd+O, Cmd+E, Cmd+Z, etc.)
- Professional undo/redo behavior (excludes playhead position from history)
- Toast notification system for user feedback
- Frame-accurate editing with 30fps snapping

#### Architecture Patterns
**Decision**: Use modular architecture with extracted utilities and custom hooks.

**Implementation**:
- Custom useHistory hook for undo/redo functionality
- Extracted utility functions for keyboard handling, drag/drop, video processing
- Component-based architecture with proper prop interfaces
- Type-safe error handling throughout the application
