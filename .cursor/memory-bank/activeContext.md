- âœ… Timeline editing (arrange clips)
- âœ… Video preview (play/pause, scrub)
- âœ… Trim functionality (frame-accurate)
- âœ… Export system (professional single-pass)

**Next Options**:
1. PR #8: Additional features (transitions, effects, etc.)
2. Polish & optimization
3. User testing & feedback

### Active Decisions

#### Memory Bank Approach
**Decision**: Create memory bank before starting development to track project patterns and maintain context across sessions.

**Rationale**: Following Cursor's memory bank pattern ensures I can maintain project knowledge and patterns consistently.

#### Development Sequence
**Decision**: Follow the 16-PR sequence from `clipforge-tasklist.md` sequentially.

**Rationale**: Each PR builds on the previous one. Skipping ahead causes dependency issues.

## Current Priorities (PR #1)

### High Priority
1. Download and configure FFmpeg binaries
2. Remove template code and create basic layout
3. Configure Tauri for file drop support
4. Test that dev environment works end-to-end

### Medium Priority
5. Add basic styling
6. Create component folder structure
7. Set up initial app state structure

### Low Priority
8. Add helpful comments
9. Create initial README content
10. Set up git (after working code exists)

## Recent Changes (Last Session)
- **Professional Export System**: Implemented industry-standard single-pass export
- Created ExportButton component with intelligent loading states
- Built professional FFmpeg filter_complex approach (single encoding pass)
- Hybrid seeking: fast `-ss` before `-i` + precise `trim` filters after
- Automatic resolution normalization: scales all clips to 1280x720 with letterboxing
- Smart filename generation with special character sanitization
- File overwrite protection with native OS dialogs
- Success banner with "Open Folder" functionality
- Comprehensive error display with expandable FFmpeg logs and retry button

- Fixed frame-accurate trim (moved `-ss` positioning)
- Fixed multi-clip concatenation (resolution normalization)
- Fixed video-only export (removed audio mapping for clips without audio)
- All 10 export tests passed successfully âœ…
- Updated memory bank to reflect PR #7 completed state
- **Core MVP complete** - All essential features implemented!

## Current Blockers
None. Core MVP features complete (PRs #1-7). Ready for additional features, polish, or user testing.

## Context for Next Session
If returning to this project:
1. Check memory bank for current state
2. Resume from activeContext.md â†’ Current Work Focus
3. Continue with PR #7 tasks (Export Trimmed Video)
4. Update activeContext.md after each completed PR

## Team/Coordination Notes
- Solo project
- No external dependencies on other team members
- Follow PRD deadlines strictly (MVP: Oct 28, Final: Oct 29)
