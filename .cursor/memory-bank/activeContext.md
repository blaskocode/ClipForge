# ClipForge - Active Context

## Current Work Focus
âœ… **PR #1 and PR #2 Complete!** Ready to begin PR #3: Video Import System.

## Current Phase: Testing & Verification Complete

### Recently Completed
- âœ… Tauri project created using `npm create tauri-app@latest`
- âœ… TypeScript + React template initialized
- âœ… Memory bank structure created
- âœ… Project state documented
- âœ… PR #1: Foundation & Setup - All tasks complete
- âœ… PR #2: File Validation - All tasks complete, unit tests passing

### Currently Working On
ðŸŸ¢ **Ready for PR #3: Video Import System** - All prerequisites met

### Recent Accomplishments

**PR #1:**
1. âœ… Created memory bank structure with 5 core files + structure rule
2. âœ… Removed default Tauri template content
3. âœ… Created folder structure (`src/components/`, `src/utils/`, `src-tauri/binaries/`)
4. âœ… Downloaded FFmpeg binaries for macOS (76MB each)
5. âœ… Configured `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` for file drop and FFmpeg bundling
6. âœ… Created basic UI layout skeleton (`src/App.tsx`, `src/App.css`)
7. âœ… Tested build successfully

**PR #2:**
1. âœ… Created `validate_video_file()` Rust command in `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`
2. âœ… Implemented file existence check using `Path::exists()`
3. âœ… Implemented file size validation (warns at 2GB, errors at 5GB)
4. âœ… Implemented extension validation for mp4, mov, webm (case-insensitive)
5. âœ… Added user-friendly error messages for all failure cases
6. âœ… Added unit tests (3 tests: nonexistent file, invalid extension, valid mp4)
7. âœ… All unit tests passing (cargo test: 3 passed, 0 failed)
8. âœ… Removed unused imports (no compiler warnings)
9. âœ… Fixed tauri.conf.json errors (removed invalid fileDropEnabled)
10. âœ… Created FFmpeg platform-specific symlinks (ffmpeg-aarch64-apple-darwin)
11. âœ… Cargo added to PATH for testing
12. âœ… Committed all changes

### Immediate Next Steps (PR #3)
1. Create `select_video_file()` Rust command using tauri-plugin-dialog
2. Implement file picker button in React UI
3. Create `get_video_metadata()` Rust command using FFprobe
4. Set up clip state management in App.tsx
5. Implement clip limit validation (max 20 clips)
6. Wire up import flow: button click â†’ file picker â†’ validation â†’ metadata â†’ state

### Active Decisions

#### Memory Bank Approach
**Decision**: Create memory bank before starting development to track project patterns and maintain context across sessions.

**Rationale**: Following Cursor's memory bank pattern ensures I can maintain project knowledge and patterns consistently.

#### Development Sequence
**Decision**: Follow the 16-PR sequence from `clipforge-tasklist.md` sequentially.

**Rationale**: Each PR builds on the previous one. Skipping ahead causes dependency issues.

## Current Priorities (PR #1)

### High Priority
1. Download and configure FFmpeg binaries
2. Remove template code and create basic layout
3. Configure Tauri for file drop support
4. Test that dev environment works end-to-end

### Medium Priority
5. Add basic styling
6. Create component folder structure
7. Set up initial app state structure

### Low Priority
8. Add helpful comments
9. Create initial README content
10. Set up git (after working code exists)

## Recent Changes (Last Session)
- Fixed tauri.conf.json validation error (removed fileDropEnabled property)
- Created FFmpeg platform-specific symlinks for Tauri bundling
- Added tauri-plugin-dialog dependency to Cargo.toml
- Fixed all compiler warnings (removed unused imports)
- Ran and verified all unit tests passing (3/3 tests)
- Added cargo to PATH environment variable
- Created PR1-PR2-TEST-CHECKLIST.md for verification tracking
- Updated memory bank to reflect completed state

## Current Blockers
None. All PRs #1 and #2 complete and tested. Ready to proceed to PR #3.

## Context for Next Session
If returning to this project:
1. Check memory bank for current state
2. Resume from activeContext.md â†’ Current Work Focus
3. Continue with PR #1 tasks starting from wherever we left off
4. Update activeContext.md after each completed PR

## Team/Coordination Notes
- Solo project
- No external dependencies on other team members
- Follow PRD deadlines strictly (MVP: Oct 28, Final: Oct 29)
