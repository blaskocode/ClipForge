13. âœ… Created comprehensive testing instructions and documentation

### Immediate Next Steps (PR #6)
1. Create TrimControls component with in/out point inputs
2. Implement trim logic with validation
3. Add visual trim indicators on timeline
4. Implement trim preview functionality
5. Add keyboard shortcuts for trim points (I/O)

### Active Decisions

#### Memory Bank Approach
**Decision**: Create memory bank before starting development to track project patterns and maintain context across sessions.

**Rationale**: Following Cursor's memory bank pattern ensures I can maintain project knowledge and patterns consistently.

#### Development Sequence
**Decision**: Follow the 16-PR sequence from `clipforge-tasklist.md` sequentially.

**Rationale**: Each PR builds on the previous one. Skipping ahead causes dependency issues.

## Current Priorities (PR #1)

### High Priority
1. Download and configure FFmpeg binaries
2. Remove template code and create basic layout
3. Configure Tauri for file drop support
4. Test that dev environment works end-to-end

### Medium Priority
5. Add basic styling
6. Create component folder structure
7. Set up initial app state structure

### Low Priority
8. Add helpful comments
9. Create initial README content
10. Set up git (after working code exists)

## Recent Changes (Last Session)
- **Major Architecture Refactoring**: Converted video player from clip-specific to universal timeline playback
- Created `getClipAtPlayhead()` function in App.tsx to determine which clip shows at any timeline position
- Implemented ~30fps playback loop that advances playhead continuously across all clips
- Refactored VideoPlayer to receive `clipAtPlayhead` prop instead of `currentClip`
- Play controls now work across entire timeline, not tied to individual clips
- Preview always shows playhead position, completely independent of clip selection
- Fixed Tauri v2 import path for `convertFileSrc` (`@tauri-apps/api/core`)
- Added MIME type mapping for proper video format support (.mov â†’ video/quicktime)
- Improved error handling: FFprobe errors now translated to user-friendly messages
- Redesigned layout using CSS Grid to prevent control overlap
- All 7 manual tests passed successfully âœ…
- Updated memory bank to reflect PR #5 completed state
- Ready to proceed with PR #6: Trim Functionality

## Current Blockers
None. All PRs #1, #2, #3, #4, and #5 complete and tested. Ready to proceed to PR #6.

## Context for Next Session
If returning to this project:
1. Check memory bank for current state
2. Resume from activeContext.md â†’ Current Work Focus
3. Continue with PR #6 tasks (Trim Functionality)
4. Update activeContext.md after each completed PR

## Team/Coordination Notes
- Solo project
- No external dependencies on other team members
- Follow PRD deadlines strictly (MVP: Oct 28, Final: Oct 29)
