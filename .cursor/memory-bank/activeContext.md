### Immediate Next Steps (PR #7)
1. Implement FFmpeg export command in Rust
2. Handle concatenation of multiple clips
3. Apply trim points during export (skip trimmed sections)
4. Add export progress tracking
5. Create export UI with file picker and progress bar

### Active Decisions

#### Memory Bank Approach
**Decision**: Create memory bank before starting development to track project patterns and maintain context across sessions.

**Rationale**: Following Cursor's memory bank pattern ensures I can maintain project knowledge and patterns consistently.

#### Development Sequence
**Decision**: Follow the 16-PR sequence from `clipforge-tasklist.md` sequentially.

**Rationale**: Each PR builds on the previous one. Skipping ahead causes dependency issues.

## Current Priorities (PR #1)

### High Priority
1. Download and configure FFmpeg binaries
2. Remove template code and create basic layout
3. Configure Tauri for file drop support
4. Test that dev environment works end-to-end

### Medium Priority
5. Add basic styling
6. Create component folder structure
7. Set up initial app state structure

### Low Priority
8. Add helpful comments
9. Create initial README content
10. Set up git (after working code exists)

## Recent Changes (Last Session)
- **Non-Destructive Trim System**: Created professional-grade trim functionality
- Created TrimControls component with frame-accurate input (30fps snapping)
- Implemented non-destructive editing model (clips maintain full timeline length)
- Added visual trim indicators: gray overlays + green/red draggable handles
- Smart playback loop automatically skips trimmed sections during preview
- Trim-aware preview clamps display to active range (inPoint to outPoint)
- Keyboard shortcuts: I/O keys for quick trim setting, Delete key for clip deletion
- Fixed 7 major issues including out-point calculation, playhead jumping, stale closures
- Manual input with separate string/numeric state for smooth typing
- Timeline deselection: clicking empty space deselects clips
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions (delete)
- All 15 manual tests passed successfully âœ…
- Updated memory bank to reflect PR #6 completed state
- Ready to proceed with PR #7: Export Trimmed Video

## Current Blockers
None. All PRs #1-6 complete and tested. Ready to proceed to PR #7.

## Context for Next Session
If returning to this project:
1. Check memory bank for current state
2. Resume from activeContext.md â†’ Current Work Focus
3. Continue with PR #7 tasks (Export Trimmed Video)
4. Update activeContext.md after each completed PR

## Team/Coordination Notes
- Solo project
- No external dependencies on other team members
- Follow PRD deadlines strictly (MVP: Oct 28, Final: Oct 29)
