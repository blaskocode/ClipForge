## PR #5 Summary
**Status**: ✅ Complete & Tested - All 7 Tests Passed
**Time**: ~5 hours (including major architecture refactoring)
**Key Deliverables**:
- VideoPlayer component with HTML5 video element
- **Universal timeline playback system** - Refactored from clip-specific to timeline-wide controls

4. Technical FFprobe errors (now user-friendly)
5. Architecture refactoring (clip-specific → universal timeline playback)

**Testing Documentation**:
- PR5-TESTING-INSTRUCTIONS.md: All 7 test categories completed and verified ✅

6. Error Handling Test ✅
7. Multiple Clips Test ✅

## PR #6 Summary
**Status**: ✅ Complete & Tested - All 15 Tests Passed
**Time**: ~6 hours (including 7 major bug fixes and architecture iterations)
**Key Deliverables**:
- TrimControls component with frame-accurate input (0.033s snapping for 30fps)
- **Non-destructive editing model** - Clips maintain full timeline length with trim metadata
- Manual trim inputs with validation, auto-clamping, and Enter/Tab to apply
- Keyboard shortcuts: I/O keys for quick trim setting at playhead position
- Visual trim indicators: gray overlays showing trimmed portions
- Draggable trim handles: green (in-point) and red (out-point) with cursor feedback
- Smart playback loop that automatically skips trimmed sections during preview
- Trim-aware video preview that clamps display to active range (inPoint to outPoint)
- Delete key with confirmation dialog for selected clips
- Timeline deselection when clicking empty space
- Reset Trim button to restore original duration
- Professional UX matching Premiere Pro / Final Cut Pro behavior
- No linter errors or warnings

**Major Issues Resolved**:
1. Out-point calculation error (relative to in-point vs start of clip)
2. Playhead jumping on trim changes (architecture iterations)
3. Manual input cutting off decimals (dual string/numeric state)
4. Stale closure in keyboard handlers (missing dependencies)
5. Delete key confirmation dialog not appearing (inline styles vs CSS classes)
6. Preview showing trimmed content (clamping to active range)
7. Multiple clip trim independence (closure dependencies)

**Architecture Decisions**:
- **Non-Destructive Editing**: Clips keep full timeline length, trim points are visual markers
- **Timeline Calculation**: Uses full durations, not active durations (prevents playhead jumps)
- **Smart Playback**: Automatically skips trimmed sections without changing timeline structure
- **Frame-Accurate Input**: All values snap to 30fps grid (0.033s intervals)

**Testing Documentation**:
- PR6-TESTING-INSTRUCTIONS.md: All 15 test cases completed and verified ✅
- PR6-COMPLETE.md: Comprehensive summary with technical details and lessons learned

**Test Results**: 15/15 Passed ✅
1. Set In Point with I Key ✅
2. Set Out Point with O Key ✅
3. Trim Range Display ✅
4. Playback Skips to In-Point ✅
5. Playback Advances at Out-Point ✅
6. Draggable Trim Handles ✅

8. Validation & Error Handling ✅
9. Visual Indicators (Gray Overlays) ✅
10. Trim Handle Positioning ✅
11. State Persistence Across Clips ✅
12. New Clips Start Untrimmed ✅
13. Preview Respects Trim Points ✅
14. Timeline Deselection ✅
15. Delete Key with Confirmation ✅
