# No Automatic Git Commits

## Description
Prevents the AI from running `git commit` commands automatically. Only commit when the user explicitly requests it.

## Rule
NEVER run `git commit` or `git add` commands unless the user explicitly asks you to commit changes.

### When NOT to commit:
- After completing tasks
- After fixing bugs or errors
- After updating files
- After code changes

### When commits ARE allowed:
- User explicitly says "commit" or "git commit"
- User says "save to git" or similar explicit instruction

### What to do instead:
- Make the requested code changes
- Tell the user what changed
- Optionally mention "ready to commit when you are"
- Don't attempt the commit yourself

## Example
❌ Bad: Automatically running `git commit` after making changes
✅ Good: Making changes and saying "Changes complete. Ready to commit when you are."
