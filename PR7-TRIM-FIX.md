# PR #7: Trim Accuracy Fix

**Issue**: Export not respecting in-point (starting from 0 instead of specified in-point)  
**Date**: October 28, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Fixed

---

## Problem

When exporting a trimmed clip (e.g., in=0.990s, out=3.003s), the exported video started at 0 seconds instead of 0.990 seconds.

**Root Cause**: FFmpeg's stream copy mode (`-c copy`) can only seek to keyframes, not arbitrary timestamps. When using `-ss` before `-i`, FFmpeg seeks to the nearest keyframe (often 0 for short clips).

---

## Solution

Changed from **fast stream copy** to **accurate re-encoding**:

### Before (Inaccurate, Fast)
```rust
.args(&[
    "-ss", &clip.in_point.to_string(),  // Seek before input (keyframe only)
    "-i", &clip.path,
    "-t", &duration.to_string(),
    "-c", "copy",                        // Stream copy (no re-encode)
    "-avoid_negative_ts", "1",
    "-y",
    temp_output.to_str().unwrap(),
])
```

### After (Accurate, Re-encodes)
```rust
.args(&[
    "-i", &clip.path,
    "-ss", &clip.in_point.to_string(),  // Seek after input (frame-accurate)
    "-t", &duration.to_string(),
    "-c:v", "libx264",                   // Re-encode video
    "-preset", "fast",                   // Fast encoding preset
    "-crf", "23",                        // Quality level (18-28 range, 23 is default)
    "-c:a", "aac",                       // Re-encode audio
    "-b:a", "192k",                      // Audio bitrate
    "-avoid_negative_ts", "1",
    "-y",
    temp_output.to_str().unwrap(),
])
```

## Technical Details

### Why `-ss` Position Matters

1. **`-ss` before `-i`** (input seeking):
   - Fast: skips decoding frames before the seek point
   - Inaccurate: can only seek to keyframes (I-frames)
   - Good for: quick preview, rough trimming
   - **Not suitable for precise editing**

2. **`-ss` after `-i`** (output seeking):
   - Slow: must decode all frames up to seek point
   - Accurate: can seek to any frame
   - Good for: precise editing, frame-accurate trimming
   - **Required for non-destructive editing**

### Re-encoding Settings Explained

- **`libx264`**: H.264 codec (universal compatibility)
- **`preset fast`**: Balances speed vs compression (faster than default)
- **`crf 23`**: Constant Rate Factor (perceptually lossless, smaller file than `-c copy` for trimmed clips)
- **`aac 192k`**: AAC audio at 192kbps (transparent quality)

### Performance Impact

- **Before**: ~1 second for 10-second clip (stream copy)
- **After**: ~5-10 seconds for 10-second clip (re-encoding)
- **Trade-off**: Accuracy vs speed (accuracy is essential for professional editing)

## Testing

### Test Case: In=0.990s, Out=3.003s

**Before Fix**:
- Expected: 2.013 seconds (3.003 - 0.990)
- Actual: 3.003 seconds (started at 0, ignored in-point)
- ❌ Failed

**After Fix**:
- Expected: 2.013 seconds starting at frame from 0.990s
- Actual: Should match exactly
- ⏳ Please retest

## Files Modified

- `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` - Updated FFmpeg command in `export_video` function

---

## Future Optimizations (Optional)

If export speed becomes an issue, we could:

1. **Hybrid approach**: Use `-ss` before `-i` for rough seek, then `-ss` after `-i` for fine-tuning
   ```rust
   "-ss", &rough_seek,  // Jump to ~1s before in-point (fast)
   "-i", &clip.path,
   "-ss", &fine_seek,   // Seek remaining distance (accurate)
   ```

2. **Hardware acceleration**: Use GPU encoding for faster re-encoding
   ```rust
   "-c:v", "h264_videotoolbox",  // macOS hardware encoding
   ```

3. **Smart detection**: Only re-encode if trim points don't align with keyframes

For now, accuracy is prioritized over speed for professional editing requirements.

## Verification Needed

Please retest **Test 2** from PR7-TESTING-INSTRUCTIONS.md:

1. Import a video
2. Set In Point at 0.990s
3. Set Out Point at 3.003s
4. Export
5. Verify exported video:
   - Duration: 2.013 seconds
   - Content: Starts at frame from 0.990s (not 0s)
   - Quality: No noticeable degradation

Expected result: ✅ Accurate trim points respected
