# PiP Fix V4 - Clip Transitions Fixed

## The Transition Problem

**Symptom:** First video plays great, but transitions to subsequent clips don't resume playback.

**What Was Happening:**
1. First clip loads and plays ✓
2. Clip reaches end → RAF loop triggers transition to next clip ✓
3. Loading effect runs, pauses video, calls `video.load()` ✓
4. Video loads, seeks to position ✓
5. But playback never resumes ❌

**From Your Logs:**
```
Loading new main clip: IMG_2384.mp4
Main clip loaded, seeking to position
[No "Resuming playback" message - stuck!]
```

## Root Cause

The loading effect's `loadedmetadata` handler was only seeking to position, not resuming playback:

```javascript
// BEFORE - No playback resume!
const syncVideoPosition = () => {
  video.currentTime = targetTime;
  // That's it! Nothing restarts playback
};
```

The play/pause effect couldn't help because:
1. It depends on `isPlaying` changing
2. But `isPlaying` stays `true` during clip transitions
3. So the effect doesn't run again
4. Video stays paused forever!

## The Solution: Use Ref to Track Play State

### 1. Added isPlayingRef ✓

```javascript
const isPlayingRef = useRef(isPlaying);

// Keep ref in sync
useEffect(() => {
  isPlayingRef.current = isPlaying;
}, [isPlaying]);
```

### 2. Resume Playback After Loading ✓

**Main Video:**
```javascript
const syncVideoPosition = () => {
  video.currentTime = targetTime;
  
  // Resume playback if we were playing (use ref, not state!)
  if (isPlayingRef.current) {
    console.log('Resuming main video playback after clip transition');
    video.play();
  }
};
```

**PiP Video:**
```javascript
const handleLoadedMetadata = () => {
  pipVideo.currentTime = targetTime;
  
  // Resume playback if we were playing (use ref, not state!)
  if (isPlayingRef.current) {
    console.log('Resuming PiP video playback after clip transition');
    pipVideo.play();
  }
};
```

### 3. Keep Dependencies Correct ✓

**Important:** Still only depends on `activeMainClip?.id` and `activePipClip?.id`
- NOT on `isPlaying` (would cause flicker)
- Use ref to access current play state without adding dependency

## Why This Works

### The Ref Pattern

**Problem with State:**
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const shouldPlay = isPlaying; // Captures value at effect creation
  // Later: this value is stale!
}, [clipId, isPlaying]); // Adding isPlaying causes flicker
```

**Solution with Ref:**
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const shouldPlay = isPlayingRef.current; // Always current value!
  // Always accurate, even if isPlaying changed
}, [clipId]); // No isPlaying dependency = no flicker
```

### Complete Transition Flow

1. **Clip reaches end** → RAF loop detects, updates `playheadPosition`
2. **activeMainClip changes** → Loading effect runs
3. **Video pauses and loads** → New source loaded
4. **loadedmetadata fires** → Handler runs:
   - Seeks to position ✓
   - Checks `isPlayingRef.current` ✓
   - Resumes playback if true ✓
5. **Seamless transition!** ✓

## Expected Console Logs

**Successful Transition:**
```
Loading new main clip: IMG_2384.mp4 (should resume: true)
Main clip loaded, seeking to position
Resuming main video playback after clip transition ✓
```

**With PiP:**
```
Loading new PiP clip: IMG_2385.mp4 (should resume: true)
PiP clip loaded, seeking to position
Resuming PiP video playback after clip transition ✓
```

## Testing Instructions

1. **Import multiple videos** (3-4 clips)
2. **Assign to tracks:**
   - 2-3 clips on Main track
   - 2-3 clips on PiP track
3. **Press spacebar** to start playback
4. **Let it play through** multiple clip transitions
5. **Expected:**
   - ✅ First clip plays smoothly
   - ✅ Transitions to second clip automatically
   - ✅ Second clip plays smoothly
   - ✅ Continues through all clips
   - ✅ Both main and PiP transition independently
   - ✅ No flicker when pressing spacebar
   - ✅ Console shows "Resuming playback" messages

## Files Modified

- `src/components/VideoPlayer.tsx` - Added isPlayingRef and playback resume logic

## Build Status

✅ Successfully compiled - No errors or warnings

## Summary

**Fixed Issues:**
1. ✅ Clip transitions now resume playback automatically
2. ✅ No flicker on spacebar press (dependencies still correct)
3. ✅ Both main and PiP videos transition smoothly
4. ✅ Console logging shows what's happening

**Key Technique:**
Using `useRef` to access current state without adding it to effect dependencies - this gives us the best of both worlds:
- Loading effect only runs when clip changes (no flicker)
- But can still access current play state to resume playback

The picture-in-picture performance should now be **completely smooth** with seamless transitions between clips!
