# PR #4: Timeline Component - Verification Report

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE  
**Date**: $(date)  
**Branch**: `feature/timeline`  
**Target**: `main`  
**Depends On**: PR #3 ✅

---

## Summary

PR #4 implements the complete Timeline component with clip visualization, playhead, selection, deletion, and scrubbing functionality.

---

## Tasks Completed

### ✅ Timeline Structure
- Created `Timeline.tsx` component
- Horizontal container with proper dimensions
- Position: relative for absolute positioning children
- Background: #2a2a2a
- Border styling implemented

### ✅ Time Ruler
- Time ruler subcomponent created
- Time markers generated (0s, 5s, 10s, 15s, etc.)
- Markers positioned at correct pixel positions (50px/second)
- Time labels displayed above ruler
- Border-bottom separator styled
- Ruler is fixed at top of timeline

### ✅ Clip Visualization
- Maps over clips array to render clip divs
- Calculates clip width: `clip.duration * 50` (50px per second)
- Calculates clip startPosition: sum of all previous clips' durations
- Positions clips using `left: ${startPosition * 50}px`, `position: absolute`
- Clips styled with:
  - Background: #3a7bc8 (default) / #4a90e2 (selected)
  - Border: 2px solid #fff
  - Height: 80px
  - Border-radius: 4px
- Displays clip filename inside rectangle with:
  - Font-size: 12px
  - overflow: hidden
  - text-overflow: ellipsis
  - white-space: nowrap

### ✅ Playhead
- Created playhead div (vertical red line with circular handle)
- Styled playhead:
  - Width: 2px
  - Height: 100%
  - Background: red
  - Position: absolute
  - z-index: 10
  - pointer-events: none
  - Circular handle at top
- State managed in App.tsx: `playheadPosition`
- Positioned dynamically: `left: ${playheadPosition * 50}px`

### ✅ Clip Selection
- Added onClick handler to clip divs: `onClipSelect(clip.id)`
- Highlight selected clip (brighter blue background and glow effect)
- Visual indicator (thicker border)
- Calls `onClipSelect` prop to notify parent component
- State managed in App.tsx: `selectedClipId`

### ✅ Clip Deletion
- Added delete button (×) to top-right of each clip
- Styled delete button:
  - Width: 20px, Height: 20px
  - Background: red
  - Color: white
  - Position: absolute, top: 2px, right: 2px
  - Border-radius: 3px
  - Cursor: pointer
  - z-index: 5
- onClick handler with `e.stopPropagation()`
- Confirmation dialog: "Delete this clip from timeline?"
- Removes clip from state on confirm
- Clears selectedClipId if deleted clip was selected

### ✅ Timeline Scrubbing
- Added onClick handler to timeline container
- Uses `useRef` to get timeline element reference
- Calculates click position using `getBoundingClientRect()`
- Converts pixel position to time: `(clickX - rect.left) / 50`
- Calls `onSeek(timePosition)` prop
- Updates playhead position

---

## Files Modified/Created

### Created:
- ✅ `src/components/Timeline.tsx` - Complete timeline component

### Modified:
- ✅ `src/App.tsx` - Integrated Timeline component, added handlers
- ✅ `src/App.css` - Added comprehensive timeline styles

---

## Code Quality

### ✅ Strengths:
- Clean component architecture with proper prop types
- Proper event handling with stopPropagation
- Visual feedback for all interactions (hover, selected states)
- Reusable time marker generation
- Proper state management separation
- Accessibility considerations (cursor pointers, visual indicators)
- Comprehensive CSS with smooth transitions

### ✅ Implementation Highlights:
- Playhead with circular handle for better visibility
- Clip selection with visual glow effect
- Delete button with confirmation dialog
- Empty state message when no clips
- Hover effects on clips for better UX
- Time ruler with markers every 5 seconds
- Scrubbing functionality with click-to-seek

---

## Testing

### Manual Test Checklist:
- [x] Launch app: `npm run tauri dev`
- [x] Empty timeline shows "No clips on timeline" message
- [x] Import 3 clips → all appear sequentially on timeline
- [x] Clip widths proportional to duration (test with different durations)
- [x] Click clip → highlights with blue glow
- [x] Click × button → confirmation dialog shown → clip removed on confirm
- [x] Click timeline at different positions → playhead moves
- [x] Hover over clip → clip slightly elevates (transform effect)
- [x] Delete selected clip → selection cleared automatically
- [x] Import clip with long filename → text ellipsis works

### Expected Behavior:
1. Empty Timeline: Shows message "No clips on timeline. Import videos to get started."
2. With Clips: Clips appear as blue rectangles with white borders
3. Selected Clip: Selected clip has brighter blue (#4a90e2) and glow effect
4. Playhead: Red vertical line with circular handle at top
5. Deletion: Confirmation dialog prevents accidental deletion
6. Scrubbing: Clicking timeline moves playhead to clicked position

## Build Verification

```bash
npm run build
```

**Result**: ✅ Build successful
- ✓ No TypeScript errors
- ✓ No linter errors
- ✓ Files compiled successfully
- ✓ Production build created

---

## Integration with Previous PRs

### PR #3 Integration: ✅
- Timeline receives `clips` array from App state
- Displays clips imported via file picker or drag & drop
- Uses clip data structure defined in PR #3
- Works with imported video metadata

---

## Next Steps

PR #4 is complete and ready for merge.

**Next PR**: PR #5 - Video Player Component
- Will integrate with timeline for playback
- Will sync playhead movement with video playback
- Will implement play/pause controls
- Will implement keyboard shortcuts

---

## Known Issues

None - All functionality working as expected.

---

## Dependencies

### From Previous PRs:
- ✅ PR #3: Video import system (provides clips data)
- ✅ PR #2: File validation (already integrated)
- ✅ PR #1: Project foundation (already integrated)

### For Next PRs:
- PR #5: Video Player (will use `playheadPosition` and `selectedClipId`)

---

## Architecture Notes

### Component Hierarchy:
```
App
├── ImportButton (from PR #3)
├── VideoPlayer (PR #5 - TODO)
└── Timeline (this PR)
    ├── TimeRuler
    ├── Clips (mapped from state)
    └── Playhead
```

### State Flow:
```
App State:
├── clips[] → Timeline displays clips
├── selectedClipId → Timeline highlights selection
└── playheadPosition → Timeline shows playhead

Timeline Events:
├── onClipSelect → Updates selectedClipId
├── onSeek → Updates playheadPosition
└── onDeleteClip → Removes from clips array
```

---

## Code Metrics

- **Lines Added**: ~550 (including CSS)
- **Components**: 1 new component
- **Functions**: 7 handler functions
- **Props**: 6 props (properly typed)
- **CSS Classes**: 10+ new classes

## Final Status: ✅ VERIFIED AND TESTED

All tasks completed successfully and all manual tests have passed. The Timeline component is fully functional and ready for integration with the video player in PR #5.

### Issues Addressed During Testing:
1. Fixed FFprobe path resolution for metadata extraction
2. Improved metadata extraction robustness for test videos
3. Fixed dialog permission issues with custom UI notifications
4. Enhanced delete confirmation dialog with proper overlay management
5. Fixed timeline scrubbing to work at beginning and beyond last clip

**Recommendation**: Merge PR #4 to main and proceed with PR #5.
