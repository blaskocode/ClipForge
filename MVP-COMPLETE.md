## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### Professional Design Patterns
1. **Non-Destructive Editing**
   - Clips maintain original length
   - Trim points stored as metadata
   - Original files never modified

2. **Single-Pass Export**
   - Complex FFmpeg filter chains
   - No temporary files
   - One encoding pass for speed and quality

3. **Universal Timeline Playback**
   - Playhead position drives everything
   - Continuous multi-clip playback
   - Smart trim skipping

4. **Code Organization**
   - 500-line file limit enforced
   - Custom React hooks (useExport, usePlaybackLoop)
   - Separated utility functions
   - Modular CSS files

### Technical Stack
- **Frontend:** React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Backend:** Tauri 2.0 + Rust
- **Video Processing:** FFmpeg + FFprobe
- **Build System:** Cargo + npm
- **State Management:** React hooks (useState, useEffect, custom hooks)
