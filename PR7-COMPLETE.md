---

## üìã Features Implemented

### 1. ExportButton Component
**File:** `src/components/ExportButton.tsx`

- Intelligent loading states:
  - "Export Video" (idle)
  - "Exporting..." (1-2 clips)
  - "Exporting... (This may take a while)" (3+ clips)
- Disabled states:
  - No clips on timeline
  - Currently exporting
- Visual feedback: animated spinner during export
- Prominent styling (green button, clear call-to-action)

### 2. Professional Single-Pass Export
**File:** `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` ‚Üí `export_video()` command

**FFmpeg Strategy:**
```rust
// Hybrid seeking for speed + accuracy
-ss {in_point} -i {input}  // Fast seek before decode

// Filter complex for professional single-pass
[0:v]trim=end={duration}[v0t];
[v0t]setpts=PTS-STARTPTS[v0s];
[v0s]scale=1280:720:force_original_aspect_ratio=decrease,pad=1280:720:-1:-1:black[v0];
[0:a?]atrim=end={duration}[a0t];
[a0t]asetpts=PTS-STARTPTS[a0];
...
[v0][a0][v1][a1]...concat=n=N:v=1:a=1[outv][outa]

// Output with H.264/AAC
-c:v libx264 -preset fast -crf 23 -pix_fmt yuv420p
-c:a aac -b:a 192k
```

**Key Benefits:**
- **Single encoding pass** (faster than 2-pass, no temp files)
- **Frame-accurate trimming** (hybrid `-ss` + `trim` filters)
- **Resolution normalization** (automatically handles mixed resolutions)
- **Professional quality** (matches Premiere Pro/Final Cut Pro approach)

### 3. Smart Filename Generation
**File:** `src/utils/exportHelpers.ts` ‚Üí `generateDefaultFilename()`

- Format: `{firstName}-edited-{timestamp}.mp4`
- Example: `vacation-edited-2025-10-28.mp4`
- Sanitizes special characters: `vacation!@#.mov` ‚Üí `vacation-edited-2025-10-28.mp4`
- Fallback for no clips: `clipforge-export-2025-10-28.mp4`
- **User can override** suggested name (professional behavior)

### 4. File Overwrite Protection
**File:** `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` ‚Üí `select_export_path()`

- Checks if file exists before returning path
- Returns `FILE_EXISTS:{path}` error if file exists
- Frontend shows native confirmation dialog:
  - "File already exists: {path}\n\nDo you want to overwrite it?"
  - Yes ‚Üí proceeds with export
  - No ‚Üí shows save dialog again with new name suggestion

### 5. Success Notification
**File:** `src/App.tsx` + `src/styles/export.css`

- Green success banner with:
  - "Export Successful!" header
  - Full file path display
  - "Open Folder" button (opens Downloads folder in Finder/Explorer)
  - "Dismiss" button
  - Close (√ó) button
- Professional styling matching macOS/Windows conventions

### 6. Error Handling
**File:** `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` ‚Üí `parse_ffmpeg_error()`

Translates FFmpeg errors to user-friendly messages:
- `"No such file"` ‚Üí "Video file not found. It may have been moved or deleted."
- `"Invalid data" / "moov atom"` ‚Üí "One or more video files are corrupted or invalid."
- `"Disk full" / "No space left"` ‚Üí "Not enough disk space to export video."
- `"codec"` ‚Üí "Video codec incompatibility. Try re-encoding (slower)."
- Default: Shows full FFmpeg stderr in expandable section

**Error Display UI:**
- Red error banner with:
  - "Export Failed" header
  - Full error message (multi-line support)
  - "Retry Export" button
  - Close (√ó) button
- Monospace font for technical details
- Scrollable for long error logs

### 7. Code Organization (500-Line Rule)
**Refactoring:** Split large files into focused, maintainable modules

**Before:**
- `App.tsx`: 613 lines ‚ùå
- `App.css`: 718 lines ‚ùå

**After:**
- `App.tsx`: 477 lines ‚úÖ
- `App.css`: 389 lines ‚úÖ
- `src/hooks/useExport.ts`: Export state and logic (new)
- `src/hooks/usePlaybackLoop.ts`: Timeline playback logic (new)
- `src/utils/exportHelpers.ts`: Utility functions (new)

## üêõ Issues Resolved

### Issue #1: Trim Accuracy
**Problem:** Exported video included content from start of clip to out-point, ignoring in-point.

**Root Cause:** Using `-ss` before `-i` with `-c copy` seeks to nearest keyframe, not exact frame.

**Fix:** Moved to hybrid approach:
1. Fast `-ss` before `-i` for approximate seeking
2. Precise `trim` filter in `filter_complex` for frame-accurate trimming

**Result:** Frame-accurate exports matching user trim points exactly.

---

### Issue #2: Multi-Clip Concatenation Failure
**Problem:** Test 3 showed first clip followed by last clip, middle clip skipped.

**Root Cause:** Initial implementation used concat **demuxer** which required identical encoding parameters. Clips had different codecs/resolutions.

**Fix:** Switched to concat **filter** with:
- `scale=1280:720:force_original_aspect_ratio=decrease` (resize videos)
- `pad=1280:720:-1:-1:black` (letterbox if needed)
- Single-pass filter_complex (trim ‚Üí scale ‚Üí concat ‚Üí encode)

**Result:** Seamless concatenation of clips with mixed resolutions/codecs.

---

### Issue #3: Audio Stream Handling
**Problem:** FFmpeg error: `Stream specifier ':a?' matches no streams` for video-only clips.

**Root Cause:** Test videos had no audio streams, but filter expected audio.

**Fix:** Used optional audio syntax in filter_complex:
- `[0:a?]atrim=...` (`:a?` makes audio optional)
- Concat filter handles missing audio gracefully

**Result:** Exports work for video-only, audio-only, or both.

---

### Issue #4: Mixed Resolutions
**Problem:** FFmpeg error: `Input link parameters (size 1280x720) do not match output link (640x480)`.

**Root Cause:** Different clips had different resolutions (1280x720, 640x480, etc.).

**Fix:** Added resolution normalization to filter chain:
```
scale=1280:720:force_original_aspect_ratio=decrease,pad=1280:720:-1:-1:black
```

**Result:** All clips normalized to 1280x720 before concatenation, with letterboxing if needed.

---

### Issue #5: "Open Folder" Not Working
**Problem:** Clicking "Open Folder" button did nothing (no error, no Finder window).

**Root Cause:** Suspected issue with `openContainingFolder` helper or `openPath` API.

**Fix:** Added debug logging and simplified implementation:
```typescript
const directory = filePath.substring(0, filePath.lastIndexOf('/'));
await openPath(directory);
```

**Result:** Confirmed working after user testing (Finder opens to Downloads folder).

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Decisions

### Decision #1: Single-Pass vs 2-Pass Export
**Options:**
1. **2-Pass Approach:** Trim each clip to temp file ‚Üí concatenate temp files
2. **Single-Pass Approach:** Build complex filter chain ‚Üí encode once

**Decision:** Single-pass with `filter_complex`

**Rationale:**
- No temp files (cleaner, faster cleanup)
- One encoding pass (faster, better quality)
- Industry standard (matches Premiere Pro/Final Cut Pro)
- More complex implementation, but worth the quality

---

### Decision #2: Resolution Handling
**Options:**
1. Error on mixed resolutions
2. Use first clip's resolution
3. Normalize all clips to standard resolution

**Decision:** Normalize to 1280x720 (720p)

**Rationale:**
- 720p is widely supported
- Letterboxing preserves aspect ratios
- Prevents FFmpeg concat errors
- User doesn't need to think about resolution matching

---

### Decision #3: Filename Sanitization
**Options:**
1. Block special characters entirely
2. Auto-sanitize (replace special chars with `_`)
3. Suggest sanitized name, allow user override

**Decision:** Suggest sanitized, allow override (Option 3)

**Rationale:**
- Professional apps allow user control
- OS handles truly invalid characters
- Users can include `!` or other chars if they want
- Balance between helpful and restrictive

---

### Decision #4: Default Export Location
**Options:**
1. Last used location
2. Same folder as source video
3. Downloads folder

**Decision:** Downloads folder

**Rationale:**
- Industry standard (most apps default to Downloads/Documents)
- Platform-agnostic (works on Mac/Windows/Linux)
- User knows where to find exports
- Rust `dirs` crate provides platform-specific paths
