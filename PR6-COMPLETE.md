# PR #6: Trim Functionality - COMPLETE ✅

**Status**: All tests passed
**Date**: October 28, 2025

## Implementation Summary

Successfully implemented professional-grade, non-destructive video trimming functionality matching the behavior of industry-standard editors like Premiere Pro and Final Cut Pro.

## Features Implemented

### 1. TrimControls Component (`src/components/TrimControls.tsx`)
- **Manual Input Fields**: Numeric inputs for in-point and out-point with frame-accurate snapping (0.033s for 30fps)
- **Button Controls**: "Set In Point (I)" and "Set Out Point (O)" buttons
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: 
  - `I` key sets in-point at playhead position
  - `O` key sets out-point at playhead position
- **Visual Feedback**: Real-time trim range display showing active duration
- **Reset Function**: "Reset Trim" button to restore original clip duration
- **Validation**: Auto-clamping and frame-accurate snapping on blur/Enter
- **State Management**: Separate string/numeric state for smooth typing experience

### 2. Non-Destructive Timeline Architecture (`src/App.tsx`)
- **Professional Behavior**: Clips maintain full visual length on timeline
- **Visual Indicators**: Gray overlays show trimmed sections
- **Trim Metadata**: `inPoint` and `outPoint` stored per clip
- **Smart Playback**: Automatically skips trimmed sections during playback
- **Timeline Calculations**: Uses full clip durations, not active durations
- **Playhead Stability**: Playhead never jumps when setting trim points

### 3. Timeline Visual Indicators (`src/components/Timeline.tsx`)
- **Gray Overlays**: Semi-transparent overlays on trimmed portions
- **Colored Trim Handles**:
  - Green handle (in-point) - draggable
  - Red handle (out-point) - draggable
- **Draggable Trim Editing**: Click and drag handles to adjust trim points
- **Clip Deselection**: Clicking empty timeline space deselects clips

### 4. Video Preview Integration (`src/components/VideoPlayer.tsx`)
- **Trim-Aware Preview**: Shows in-point frame when scrubbing before in-point
- **Out-Point Clamping**: Shows out-point frame when scrubbing after out-point
- **Active Range Display**: Only shows active (non-trimmed) content during preview

### 5. Keyboard Shortcuts & UX
- **Delete/Backspace**: Delete selected clip with confirmation dialog
- **I/O Keys**: Quick trim point setting at playhead position
- **Enter Key**: Apply trim value from manual input
- **Spacebar**: Global play/pause (from PR #5)
- **Input Protection**: Shortcuts disabled when typing in input fields

## Key Technical Decisions

### Non-Destructive Editing Model
**Decision**: Clips maintain full visual length on timeline, trim points are metadata only.

**Rationale**: 
- Matches professional video editor behavior (Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro)
- Provides visual context while trimming
- Easy to undo/adjust trim points
- Industry standard approach

### Timeline Duration Calculation
**Architecture**: Timeline uses **full** clip durations, not active (trimmed) durations.

**Benefits**:
- Simple 1:1 mapping between timeline position and video time
- Playhead never jumps when adjusting trim points
- Visual consistency - clips don't shrink/expand
- Trim overlays clearly show what's excluded

### Smart Playback Loop
**Implementation**: Playback automatically skips trimmed sections.

**Mechanism**:
```typescript
// During playback, check if we're in a trimmed section
if (localTime < clip.inPoint) {
  return clipStart + clip.inPoint; // Skip to in-point
}
if (localTime >= clip.outPoint) {
  return clipEnd; // Skip to next clip
}
```

### Frame-Accurate Input
**Implementation**: All trim values snap to 0.033s frame boundaries (30fps).

**User Experience**:
- Type any value (e.g., "5.020")
- Press Enter or Tab
- Auto-snaps to nearest frame (e.g., "5.033")

## Issues Encountered & Resolved

### Issue 1: Out-Point Calculation Error
**Problem**: Out-point was being set relative to in-point instead of start of clip.

**Root Cause**: Timeline position calculation wasn't accounting for full clip durations correctly.

**Solution**: Simplified calculation to use full clip durations with direct offset mapping.

### Issue 2: Playhead Jumping on Trim Change
**Problem**: Multiple architecture iterations to find correct timeline model.

**Attempted Solutions**:
1. Timeline shrinks with trim (caused playhead jumps)
2. Complex position recalculation (still had edge cases)
3. **Final Solution**: Non-destructive model with full clip durations

### Issue 3: Manual Input Cutting Off Decimals
**Problem**: Typing "1.438" would lock at "1" due to immediate validation.

**Root Cause**: Controlled input with immediate re-rendering from parent state.

**Solution**: Dual state (string for display, number for logic) with validation on blur.

### Issue 4: Stale Closure in Keyboard Handlers
**Problem**: Switching clips caused in/out points to use wrong clip's values.

**Root Cause**: `useEffect` dependencies missing `inPoint` and `outPoint`.

**Solution**: Added all closure dependencies to effect deps array.

### Issue 5: Delete Key Not Showing Dialog
**Problem**: Keyboard handler fired but dialog didn't appear.

**Root Cause**: Dialog used CSS classes that didn't exist.

**Solution**: Use inline styles (matching Timeline component approach).

### Issue 6: Preview Showing Trimmed Content
**Problem**: Scrubbing to trimmed sections showed trimmed content.

**Root Cause**: VideoPlayer displaying raw `localTime` without clamping.

**Solution**: Clamp display time to active range (inPoint to outPoint).

### Issue 7: Multiple Independent Clip Trim Issues
**Problem**: Setting trim on Clip 2 affected Clip 1's trim points.

**Root Cause**: Missing closure dependencies in keyboard handler.

**Solution**: Added `inPoint`, `outPoint`, and `clips` to dependencies.

## Code Quality

### Component Structure
- **TrimControls**: ~320 lines, well-organized with clear sections
- **Timeline**: Updated with trim overlay rendering
- **VideoPlayer**: Enhanced with trim-aware preview
- **App.tsx**: Clean state management and handlers

### Performance Considerations
- Playback loop runs at ~30fps (33ms intervals)
- Minimal re-renders using proper React patterns
- Efficient trim calculations with early returns

### Professional UX Features
- Frame-accurate snapping (30fps grid)
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- Visual feedback (colors, overlays, handles)
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users
- Input protection (shortcuts disabled while typing)
- Auto-clamping and validation

## Testing Results

All 15 manual test cases passed:
1. ✅ Set in-point with I key

4. ✅ Playback skips to in-point
5. ✅ Playback advances at out-point
6. ✅ Draggable trim handles work
7. ✅ Manual input with frame-accurate snapping
8. ✅ Validation prevents invalid ranges
9. ✅ Visual indicators (gray overlays)
10. ✅ Trim handles positioned correctly
11. ✅ State persists across clip switches
12. ✅ New clips start untrimmed
13. ✅ Preview respects trim points
14. ✅ Empty timeline click deselects
15. ✅ Delete key works with confirmation

## Files Modified

### New Files
- `src/components/TrimControls.tsx` (320 lines)

### Modified Files
- `src/App.tsx` - Trim state management, playback loop, keyboard handlers
- `src/App.css` - TrimControls and trim indicator styles
- `src/components/Timeline.tsx` - Visual overlays, draggable handles, deselection
- `src/components/VideoPlayer.tsx` - Trim-aware preview clamping
- `src/components/TrimControls.tsx` - Multiple refinements for UX

## Next Steps: PR #7

**Title**: Export Trimmed Video
**Description**: Implement FFmpeg-based video export respecting trim points
**Estimated Complexity**: High (FFmpeg integration, progress tracking, file I/O)

**Key Requirements**:
- Only export active (non-trimmed) portions
- Concatenate multiple clips
- Show export progress
- Handle export errors gracefully
- Save to user-selected location

## Lessons Learned

1. **Professional behavior matters**: Taking time to match industry-standard UX pays off
2. **Architecture iterations**: Sometimes you need to try multiple approaches to find the right one
3. **Closure dependencies**: React hooks require careful dependency management
4. **Inline vs CSS styles**: Sometimes inline styles are the pragmatic choice
5. **Frame-accurate editing**: Small details (30fps snapping) make the editor feel professional

## Conclusion

PR #6 successfully implements a professional, non-destructive trim system that matches the behavior and UX of industry-leading video editors. The implementation is robust, well-tested, and ready for the next phase: video export.
